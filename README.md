## Introduction
In this project we are developing an energy management system that will enable real-time monitoring of energy consumption within industrial facilities. It can further be scaled to commercial and residential facilites. This will provide business owners, building owners and facility managers with a centralized visibility into the energy consumption patterns which can be analysed to increase efficiency and cut down their energy costs by 10-20%. It will also provide asset health data that will enable predictive maintenance through automated alerts to avoid future equipment breakdown and sudden power cuts again saving them on costs. Overall this will improve the facilitiesâ€™ electrical health and safety.

## Approach
Using the data collected from the sensors, we made predictions for the next possible failure date using the LSTM Model. This was compared with the actual failure date.
